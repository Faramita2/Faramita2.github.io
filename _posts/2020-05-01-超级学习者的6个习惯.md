---

> Becoming a super learner is one of the most important skills you need to succeed in the 21st century. In the age technological change, staying ahead depends on continual self-education — a lifelong mastery of new models, skills and ideas.

成为超级学习者是在21世纪成功的最重要的技能之一。在技术变革的时代，保持领先取决于持续性的自我学习——终生掌握新模型、新技能和新想法。

> In a world that’s changing fast, the ability to learn a new skill as fast as possible is quickly becoming a necessity. The good news is, you don’t need a natural gift to be better at learning something new even when you have a full-time career.

处在一个快速变化的世界，尽可能快的掌握新技能变得必要。好消息是，即使你处于全职工作，也不需要天赋才能学会某些新东西。

> Many polymaths (people who have excelled in diverse pursuits) — including Charles Darwin, Leonardo da Vinci and the Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman — claimed not to have exceptional natural intelligence.

许多多元数学家（在各种研究都有突出成就的人）——比如Charles Darwin，Leonardo da Vinci以及诺贝尔物理学奖获得者Richard Feynman——都声称没有异于常人的智力

> We all have enough brainpower to master a new discipline — we use the right tools, approaches, or apply what we learn correctly. Almost anyone can learn anything — with the right technique.

我们都有足够的脑力掌握一个新的学科——我们会使用正确的工具
方法或应用我们正确学习的知识。几乎任何人都可以学好任何东西——只需要正确的技术。

> Better learning approaches can make the process enjoyable. The key to rapid skill acquisition isn’t complicated. If you aim to learn a new skill to improve your career this year, some of these habits can be useful for you.

更好的学习方法能够使学习过程充满乐趣。加快技能的学习关键并不复杂。如果今年你想通过学习新的技能来改善你的职业生涯，以下这些习惯会对你有所帮助。

> 1. Super learners read a lot

1. 超级学习者会大量阅读

> Reading is to the mind what exercise is to your body. It gives us the freedom to roam the expanse of space, time, history, and offer a deeper view of ideas, concepts, emotions, and body of knowledge.

阅读对于思想就如同身体的锻炼。它给我们跳脱空间、时间和历史的自由，提供了更深的想法、概念、情感以及知识体系。

> Your brain on books is active — growing, changing and making new connections and different patterns, depending on the type of material you’re reading. Highly successful learners read a lot.

你的大脑字阅读时是活跃的——成长着、变化着、建立新的联系和不同的模式，取决于你阅读的材料的类型。高度成功的学习者会大量阅读。

> In fact, many of the most successful people share this appreciation for reading — they don’t see reading as a chore but as an opportunity to improve their lives, careers and businesses.

事实上，许多最成功的人纷纷表示对阅读的喜爱——他们不会将阅读视为一种琐事，而是当成一种改善生活、职业以及商业的机会。

Elon Musk长大后每天读两本书，据他的兄弟说。Bill Gates一年读50本书。Mark Zuckerberg每两周至少读一本书。Warren Buffett每天花5到6小时阅读5份报纸和500页公司报告。

> In a world where information is the new currency, reading is the best source of continuous learning, knowledge and acquiring more of that currency.

处于一个信息就是货币的世界，阅读是持续学习、知识以及获取更多这种货币的最佳来源。

> 2. Super learners view learning as a process

2. 超级学习者把学习当成一个过程

> Learning is a journey, a discovery of new knowledge, not a destination.

学习是一场旅程，是新知识的探索，不是目的。

> It’s an enjoyable lifelong process — a self-directed and self-paced journey of discovery. Understanding any topic, idea or new mindset requires not only keen observation but more fundamentally, the sustained curiosity.

它是一个愉悦的终生的过程——是一场自我指导和自我安排的发现之旅。理解任何话题、主意或想法，需要的不仅仅是敏锐的洞察力，更重要的是持续的好奇心。

> “A learning journey is a curated collection of learning assets, both formal and informal, that can be used to acquire skills for a specific role and/or technology area,” writes Sonia Malik of IBM.

"学习之旅是正式和非正式的精选集，是用来掌握特定角色或技术领域的技能"，IBM的Sonia Malik写道。


> Learning is an investment that usually pays for itself in increased earnings. More than ever, learning is for life if you want to stay relevant, indispensable and thrive in the changing world of work.

学习是一项在通常可以增加收入的投资。除此之外，如果你想在不断变化的世界中工作保持相关性、必不可少和蓬勃发展，保持终生学习。

> Super learners value the process. They don’t have an end goal, they seek consistent improvement. They keep mastering new principles, processes, worldviews, thinking models, etc. The “ongoing, voluntary, and self-motivated” pursuit of knowledge is important for their maturity.

超级学习者重视这一过程。他们不会有最终的目标，他们寻找持续改善。他们不断掌握新规则、进程、世界观、思考模型等等。持续的、志愿的以及自驱动的知识追求是他们的发展的重要因素。

> 3. They adopt a growth mindset

3. 他们采用成长心态

> You can’t go wrong cultivating a growth mindset — a learning theory developed by Dr Carol Dweck that revolves around the belief that you can improve intelligence, ability and performance.

培养成长心态不会有错——一项由Carol Dweck博士开发的学习理论，它围绕着能使你改善智力、能力和表现力展开。

> “The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn,” argues Alvin Toffler, a writer, futurist, and businessman known for his works discussing modern technologies.

Alvin Toffler，作家、未来学家以及商人，以他讨论现代科技的作品而闻名，表明"21世纪的文盲不是那些不能读或写的人，而是那些不能学、不想学、不能重新学习的人“。

> Cultivating a growth or adaptable mindset can help you focus more on your most desirable goals in life. It may influence your motivation and could make you more readily able to see opportunities to learn and grow your abilities.

培养一个成长型或适应型的思维能帮助你更聚焦人生中最理想的目标。他能影响你的积极性而且能使你更充分的看到学习和提升你能力的机会。

> The ability to keep an open-mind, acquire better knowledge and apply it when necessary can significantly improve your life and career.

保持开放的心态、掌握更多的知识并且在必要时应用它能够显著的改善你的生活和职业。

> 4. Super learners teach others what they know

4. 超级学习者传授他人自己学到的东西

> According to research, learners retain approximately 90% of what they learn when they explain/teach the concept to someone else, or use it immediately.

研究表明，当学习者表述或教给他人自己所学到的东西，或立即去应用它们时，能够掌握90%的知识。

> Teaching others what you know is one of the most effective ways to learn, remember and recall new information.

教给他人你所学到的知识是最有效率的学习、记忆和重现新信息的方式之一。

> Psychologists, call it the “retrieval practice”. It’s one of the most reliable ways of building stronger memory traces.

心理学家称之为“恢复训练”。它是建立更健壮记忆路线的最可靠的方式之一。

> Learn by teaching someone else a topic in simple terms so you can quickly pinpoint the holes in your knowledge. It’s a mental model coined by the famous physicist Richard Feynman.

通过以简单的术语教给其他人去学习以至于你能快速的查明知识的空缺处。它是一个由著名物理学奖Richard Feynman阐明的心理模型。

> Known as the “Great Explainer,” Feynman was revered for his ability to clearly illustrate dense topics like quantum physics for virtually anybody. The Feynman Technique is laid out clearly in James Gleick’s biography, Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman.

Feynman以”卓越的表达者“而闻名，以他能清晰的向任何人阐述密集的话题如量子物理学受到尊敬。Feynman技术在James Gleick的传记*Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman*有明确阐述。

> The ultimate test of your knowledge is your capacity to transfer it to another. A better way to learn, process, retain and remember information is to learn half the time and share half the time. Example, instead of completing a book, aim to read 50 percent and try recalling, sharing, or writing down the key ideas you have learned before proceeding.

对你知识的最终测试是你传递它给其他人的能力。更好的学习、处理、回忆和记忆信息的方式是花一半时间学习然后花一半时间分享。比如说，相比于完成一本书，在继续之前有目的的读完50%然后试图回忆、分享或者写下学过的关键点。

> 5. Effective learners take care of their brains

高效的学习者会照顾好他们的大脑

> Keeping your brain healthy keeps it sharp. What you do or don’t do for your brain can significantly change how your record, process and retrieve information. Everyone wants to live an active life for as long as possible. And that goal depends on robust brain health.

保持你的大脑健康能使他保持锋利。你对大脑做过的以及不做的事都会显著的改变你如何记忆、处理和取回信息。每个人都想要尽可能活得积极。而达成这个目标取决于健壮健康的大脑。

> That means eating lots of foods associated with slowing cognitive decline — blueberries, vegetables (leafy greens — kale, spinach, broccoli), whole grains, getting protein from fish and legumes and choosing healthy unsaturated fats (olive oil) over saturated fats (butter).

这意味着需要吃许多能够与减缓认知衰弱的食物——蓝莓、蔬菜（绿叶蔬菜——羽衣、甘蓝、菠菜、西兰花），全麦类食物、从鱼类和蔬菜身上获取蛋白质，选择健康的不饱和脂肪（橄榄油）而不是饱和脂肪（黄油）。

> "Fruit and vegetables combat age-related oxidative stress that causes wear and tear on brain cells", says Dr Gary Small, a professor of psychiatry and ageing.

“水果和蔬菜能够抵抗能引发导致脑细胞损耗与年龄相关的氧化应激”，Gary Small博士说，他是一位精神病学和衰老教授。

> Our brains naturally decline if we do nothing to protect them. However, if you intervene early, you can slow the decline process — it’s easier to protect a healthy brain than to try to repair damage once it is extensive.

如果我们没有做任何措施去保护他们，我们的大脑会自然的衰老。然而，如果你干预得灶，你能够减缓衰老的过程——相比维护衰老扩散的大脑，保护健康的大脑要简单得多。

> 6. They take short breaks, early and often

6. 他们休息的短、早且频繁

> Downtime is crucial to retaining anything you choose to learn. According to recent research, taking short breaks, early and often, can help you learn things better and even improve your retention rate.

休息是保留任何你选择学习的知识的关键。最近的研究表明，短、早且频繁的休息能帮助你学得更好，甚至能改善你的保留率。

> “Everyone thinks you need to ‘practice, practice, practice’ when learning something new. Instead, we found that resting, early and often, maybe just as critical to learning as practice,” said Leonardo G. Cohen, M.D., Ph.D., a senior investigator at NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

“每个人都觉得学习一个新东西时，就是需要不断的练习“。相反的，我们发现休息得早且频繁，可能和边学边练一样重要“。美国国立卫生研究院国家神经疾病与中风研究所的高级研究员莱昂纳多·科恩（Leonardo G. Cohen），医学博士

> Better breaks help the brain solidify, memories during the rest periods. Whatever you choose to learn over time, it’s important to optimise the timing of rest intervals for better results.

更好的休息在休息期间帮助大脑巩固、和记忆。不管你随时间学习什么，重要的是优化休息的时间以或得更好的结果。

> Experts at the Louisiana State University’s Center for Academic Success recommends 30–50 minutes sessions. “Anything less than 30 is just not enough, but anything more than 50 is too much information for your brain to take in at one time,” says learning strategies graduate assistant Ellen Dunn.

Louisiana State University’s Center for Academic Success的专家们推荐30-50分钟休息时间。“任何时间少于30分钟都是不够的，但是时间超过50分钟对你的大脑无法一次性吸收是过量的信息”。学习策略研究生助教Ellen Dunn说。

> Our brains’ neural networks need to time process information, so spacing out your learning helps you memorise new information more efficiently — give your brain enough time to rest and recover.

我们的大脑神经网络需要时间去处理信息，所以放空你的学习能帮助你记忆新的信息更有效率——给你的大脑足够的时间去休息和恢复。
